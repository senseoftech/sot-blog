# Include .well-known folder in your asp.net core project

## ```.well-known/acme-challenge/***```not found (http 404)

In case where you want to use Let's Encrypt and you choose the manual way and passing the value  http for the --preferred-challenges argument to generate a certificate. You should have not found (404) http response for a file inside this folder. 
<!--more-->

For my example, I create the directory ```.well-known``` inside the wwwroot directory. 

To resolve this issue you need to add the following statement to solve it: 

```csharp
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            // ...
            app.UseStaticFiles(new StaticFileOptions
            {
                FileProvider = new PhysicalFileProvider(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), @"wwwroot/.well-known")),
                RequestPath = new PathString("/.well-known"),
                ServeUnknownFileTypes = true // serve extensionless file
            });
            // ...
        }
```

You should add this configuration statement after the line ```app.UseStaticFiles();```.

This statement requires to add some using :

* ```using System.IO;```
* ```using Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders;```
* ```using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http```

The folder may not appear in Visual Studio. You can add the following configuration lines in the csproj file of your project : 

```json 
    <ItemGroup>
        <Content Include="wwwroot\.well-known\acme-challenge\**" />
    </ItemGroup>
```
