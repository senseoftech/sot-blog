ngrok exposes local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels.

<!--more-->

Start by downloading the exe file at this location: https://ngrok.com/download

Extract the application, open a console application and go on the directory where ngrok was extracted.

Launch the ngrok.exe application and add the port to expose:

{% highlight c %}

ngrok http 8081

{% endhighlight %}

In addition, if you use the IIS Express with Visual Studio, you need to configure more to reach your application. 

* Alter the file applicationhost.config (in the folder : [VSPROJECTFOLDER]/.vs/config/ ),
* Found the line contains "*:8081:localhost" and remove ":localhost" to have only "*:8081".
* Restart your visual studio.

* Call the ngrok with :
{% highlight c %}

ngrok http 8081 -host-header="localhost:8081"

{% endhighlight %}
 Once the ngrok launch you get an access to your tunnel by and url i e : http://1cac6d41.ngrok.io
